The Composite Pattern allows us to build structures of objects in the form of trees
that contain both compositions of objects and individual objects as nodes.
Using a composite structure, we can apply the same operations over both
composites and individual objects. In other words, in most cases we can ignore
the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects.
