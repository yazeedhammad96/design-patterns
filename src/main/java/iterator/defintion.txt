The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation

The Iterator Pattern allows traversal of the elements of an aggregate without
exposing the underlying implementation.
It also places the task of traversal on the iterator object, not on the aggregate,
which simplifies the aggregate interface and implementation, and places the
responsibility where it should be.
